      <p>
        Oxford Hub is launching a new programme to build a community response to
        Covid. Itâ€™s time to get together to ensure we can provide support to the
        most vulnerable in our communities, and make sure that we are looking
        out for one another during this time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Become a community champion and help others across the city by checking
        in on those who are at high-risk on your street, or a phone champion
        making phone calls to check in on those who are self-isolating.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sparing just a few minutes of your day can make a huge difference to
        someone who is at high-risk or already ill.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're self-isolating or at high risk, you can refer yourself to get
        community support via the "get support" button (coming soon). For any
        questions, please email{" "}
        <a href="mailto:hello@oxfordtogether.org">hello@oxfordtogether.org</a>.
